# CityViewPlus

CityViewPlus was a system that was constructed by a team of three students. CityViewPlus visualizes data from datasets that are attributed to and describe Boston.

# ABSTRACT
The goal of this project is to deliver on visualizations that tell a story which is clear and understandable to the masses. To accomplish this goal, we will complete two main objectives. First, we will identify categories and subjects we want to tackle based on the datasets we can utilize. Afterwards, we will create a website which utilizes these up to date datasets and clear, understandable data visualizations which will each describe a phenomenon in the city of Boston.

# FEATURES

Livability
The Livability section offers a simple visualization that allows users to view the conditions, amenities and features of different districts in Boston. Users can select what they would specifically like to view to get a better picture of the specifics of each district.

Demographics
The Demographics section allows a user to understand the demographics of each neighborhood in Boston, this is presented via a selectable sunburst diagram. We also allow the user to view what the same neighborhoods demographics were in the past few decades. We also show the data as a bar chart when interacting with the sunburst diagram, so the data might be more easily understood.

Events
The Events section offers users to view some of the most current occurrences in Boston. A user interacting with the events visualizations will be able to learn about the most recent crime statistics reported by the Boston police daily. One can also get some basic info by zooming into a specific crime and selecting it to determine the nature of the crime, when it was committed, and any other documentation provided by the Boston police.
