# CityViewPlus

CityViewPlus is a system that was constructed by a team of three WPI students. CityViewPlus provides visualizations of data from the city of Boston.

# ABSTRACT

The goal of this project is to deliver on visualizations that tell a story which is clear and understandable to the masses. To accomplish this goal, we will complete two main objectives. First, we will identify categories and subjects we want to tackle based on the datasets we can utilize. Afterwards, we will create a website which utilizes these up to date datasets and clear, understandable data visualizations which will each describe a phenomenon in the city of Boston.

# FEATURES

## Livability

The Livability section offers a simple visualization that allows users to view the conditions, amenities and features of different neighborhoods in Boston. Users can select which aspects of each neighborhood they would like to view.

## Demographics

The Demographics section allows a user to better understand the demographics of each neighborhood in Boston over the past few decades. This is presented via a selectable sunburst diagram. We also show the data as a bar chart when interacting with the  diagram.

## Events

The Events section offers users to view some of the most current occurrences in Boston. A user interacting with the events visualizations will be able to learn about the most recent crime statistics reported by the Boston police, updated daily. One can also get some basic info by selecting a specific crime to determine the nature of the crime, when it was committed, and any other documentation provided by the Boston police.
